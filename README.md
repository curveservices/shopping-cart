## Assets

## Obejective

1. Create a new React project.
2. You should have at least two pages (a home page and a shop page, which includes your shopping cart). Let the user navigate between the pages with a navigation bar, which will be shown on both pages.
3. To your homepage, you can add whatever you’d like! A few images or information will be totally fine; it doesn’t have to be something fancy - it’s to test the concepts taught thus far.
4. On the shopping cart page, you should have the same navigation bar that displays the number of items currently in the cart. You should also have a button next to it where you can go to the cart to checkout and pay (however we are not going to implement this logic here).
5. Build individual card elements for each of your products. Display an input field on it, which lets a user manually type in how many items they want to buy. Also, add an increment and decrement button next to it for fine-tuning. You can also display a title for each product as well as an “Add To Cart” button.
6. Fetch your shop items from FakeStore API or something similar.
7. Once a user has submitted their order, the amount on the cart itself should adjust accordingly.
8. Make sure to test your app thoroughly using the React Testing Library.
9. As usual, style your application and deploy it!
